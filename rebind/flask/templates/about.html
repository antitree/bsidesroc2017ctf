<h1>Disbanding Attacks</h1>
<p>A disbanding attack is known by Tor and VPN services  
to surreptitiously induce a client into leaking information outside
of the normal means of communication. 

In the case of Tor, a common 
disbanding attack is when the tor client accientally makes a DNS
request routed in the clear and not through the Tor Network. The 
result is the DNS request to the page your were visiting is not
anonymous at all, but able to be seen by your ISP, network 
administrators, or anyone listing on the wire. </p>

<h1>What does this do?</h1>
This project is an example of the types of attacks server operators can 
perform on their users in an attempt to evade the protective measures they 
using such as Tor, VPN, or a proxy. 

This system logs unique identifying information for no more than 3 minutes after which time the system if flushed and no logs are permanently stored. This project is designed for demonstrative purposes. 

<h1>What is this CTF challenge?</h1>
You damn kids with your modern browsers don't appreciate the things that Tor Browser Bundle can do for you so you can check your privelege at the door. Your challenge is to exploit yourself. You need to use something at your school, something on your personal network, and something out on the internet to accomplish this. 

Here are some hashtags of things you might want to research: #requesocks, #json, #dns, #webrtc 

<h1>API</h1>
<p>There's also an undocumented API that makes it easier to determine the results when using scripts. Below is an example</p>

Request:
<pre>http://WHATEVERHOSTNAMEIGAVEYOU/v1/test</pre>

Response:
<pre>{'0': '1.1.1.1', '40': '2.2.2.2'}</pre>
<p>the first number is the test type. 0 is for the standard remote IP check, 40 is for the DNS lookup via redirect test</p>

<h1>Attacks Explanation</h1>
<h2>WebRTC Private IP Disclosure</h2>
<p>This attack uses the WebRTC's NAT traversing technology to uncover
the true IP's of the user. This attack has been documented by many people
as a way of bypassing VPNs, Proxies, and Tor to uncover a user's public 
and private IP addresses. NOTE: I've customized it not to work in Firefox or TBB</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Disable WebRTC</p>

<h2>DNS Leakage</h2>
<p>When a client is not properly configured to use a proxy, in many cases, it will decide to do DNS lookups using the systems normal DNS configuration. That usually means using the ISP's DNS server or an internal one. In this case, the DNS is passed in the clear, without the protections of the proxy. This example shows that not only the ISP can identify the DNS request, but owner of the domain as well. In practice, the IP identified is not always the original requesting IP's DNS server because of how DNS works. </p>

<p><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Ensure that proxy clients always route DNS requests over the proxy. VPN services should be configured not to accidentally perform DNS requests out-of-band. When using Tor, the Tor Browser Bundle and TAILS are pre-configured to prevent accidental leakage. </p>
