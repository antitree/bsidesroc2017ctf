# About

You may be asking yourself, "What is NAS formatting." Well let me give you the nitty gritty on what
the NAS formatting industry is all about.

Are you tired of formatting your NAS? Sure we all are. That's why if you ship it to us, and provide
formatting type, partition sizes, and whether or not you'd like us to install malicious firmware
into the drive or NAS itself, we'll return it to you in a matter of weeks!

Why sit and wait in your house for hours while you're NAS is formatting when you can hire 6 retired
lawyers to do it for you!

NAS formatting as a service (NASFaaS) is not only a way to waste time, it's also a way to waste other
peoples time. Are you a lazy person that's one true skill is looking busy, then we want you. Submit
your resume to resume@bsidesroc.com and we'll probably call you. Someday. I don't know, we're lazy too.
