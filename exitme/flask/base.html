      <h1>DNS Rebinding</h1>
      <p>DNS rebinding is an attack that attempts to induce a user into 
      letting an attacker execute code that will attempt to load internal
      network resources. This is done by running a malicious DNS server 
      that when queried, returns an internal IP of the victims machine
      instead of a public IP of a remote host. If executed, this bypasses
      the same-origin policy and the code can attempt to access internal resources to exfiltrate back to the attacker. </p>

      <h1>DNS Disbanding</h1>
      <p>A disbanding attack is known by Tor and other anonymity systems
      to surreptitiously induce a client into leaking information outside
      of the normal means of communication. In the case of Tor, a common 
      disbanding attack is when the tor client accientally makes a DNS
      request routed in the clear and not through the Tor Network. The 
      results is the DNS request to the page your were visiting is not
      anonymous at all, but able to be seen by your ISP or network 
      administrators. </p>

      <p>This is a proof-of-concept to show whether various browsing
      functions disband DNS requests.</p>
